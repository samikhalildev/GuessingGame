# guessingGame
This was created to practice and for fun. The program generates a random number and you have 5 attempts to guess it. It will tell you if the number you entered is too small or too large. You also get bounce points if you guess the number in your first or second try. Try to get to level 10 and score atleast 50 points in total.
